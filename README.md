A small website to rate teaching assistants not based on a direct score but rather evaluate categories with a simple tinder like survey design.

The complete website was written at the Viscon Hackathon in Django + Vue.js by a team of 5 in 2 days.

The website is hosted under https://happy-honeyberries.svis.ethz.ch/ if still available.
